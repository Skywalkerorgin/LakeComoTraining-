# Generation of the Pareto Front: 
Figures/generate_pareto.py

# Visualization of Policies 
Figures/Plot_Policy.py with an example for how to format the text file. Once you have the lake level, release, and forecast, I sorted by day so that all of the same days are in a block. Then, use AverageScript.R to get an average value for each day and plot using Plot_Policy.
